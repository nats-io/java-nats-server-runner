Java Server Runner for the <a href="http://nats.io">NATs messaging system</a>.
<p><img src="large-logo.png" alt="nats logo"></p>

<p>NATS Server is a simple, high performance open source messaging system for cloud native applications, IoT messaging, and microservices architectures.
  This Java API opens the server to Java applications. The API is performant, supporting millions of messages a second, and easy to use.
</p>

<p>The server runner allows you start a NATS server from java code. The most typical use is for executing unit tests against a live server.</p>

<p><em>This package is implemented with Java 8 features.</em></p>
